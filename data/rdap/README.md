IANA maintains a [bootstrap file](https://data.iana.org/rdap/dns.json) for RDAP servers for DNS.  There are also [bootstrap files](https://data.iana.org/rdap/) for ASNs and IP addresses.

IANA also maintains a list of [RDAP servers for registrars](https://www.iana.org/assignments/registrar-ids/registrar-ids.xhtml).  In theory, a registrar should answer a query to a domain registered through them.  I have found this is not always true.
